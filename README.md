# Twitter Likes

A Twitter bot that helps you gain new followers.

# How does it work?

1. Connect your Twitter account and add Twitter developer credentials (API Key, etc.)
2. Add target accounts. The app will then sync their followers to its local database.
3. Each follower's latest tweets will be scanned. If there's a recent and relevant enough tweet, the app will place a like automatically.

The idea is that, the target accounts have a similar audience as the one you wish to build for yourself. By liking their tweets, you can attract these people into your profile, and potentially following you.
